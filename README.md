Client-server Java application running at the following scenario:

1. The client after you start waiting for user input.

2. The user enters the number to the client.

3. The client sends the number to the server using the TCP protocol and is waiting for input user.

4. The server arranges the number of primes, and sends the response to the client.

5. Client reports the result to the user.


The application meets the following requirements:

1. The client must be a console application, and use the command line interface.

2. The server must be implemented in Java. Selecting library is not specified, but simple solutions evaluated.

3. You can enter multiple numbers at the client without waiting for responses from server.

4. The server must support the simultaneous servicing multiple clients.

5. The source code should have comments.

6. It is desirable to provide an application unit tests.
